"""Aggregate the suspend/resume phase-breakdown log records into a report.

Reads the atelet and worker pod logs, either as kubectl logs dumps (JSON
lines; unrelated lines are skipped) or as a Cloud Logging export
(`gcloud logging read --format json`: a JSON array of entries with the record
under jsonPayload), and aggregates the two joinable record kinds the node
side emits, each written by both layers:

  - "Restore timing breakdown"     atelet (ate.actor.restore.duration.*)
                                   and ateom (ateom.actor.restore.duration.*)
  - "Checkpoint timing breakdown"  atelet (ate.actor.checkpoint.duration.*)
                                   and ateom (ateom.actor.checkpoint.duration.*)

The report answers "where does the SuspendActor / ResumeActor time go":
per-phase percentiles at each layer, and the slowest operations as nested
waterfalls (the ateom record joined under the atelet record of the same
actor).

Usage:
    phase_report.py run-logs/*.log [--csv DEST_DIR] [--slowest N]

Feed it one source per run: the kubectl dumps, or the Cloud Logging export,
not both, or every record counts twice.

The records are developer-facing logs, not metric API; this reader is the
consumer that makes them percentiles. See benchmarking/analysis/README.md.
