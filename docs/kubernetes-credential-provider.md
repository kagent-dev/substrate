# Kubernetes credential provider

The `k8s-credential-provider` Deployment follows the provider from
[upstream](https://github.com/agent-substrate/substrate/pull/1335). It serves
`CredentialProvider.FetchSecret` at `k8s-credential-provider.ate-system.svc:50051`
with its own ServiceAccount and projected serving certificate. AGW calls it
directly over mTLS to inject credentials into HTTP and intercepted HTTPS requests.

`ate-secret://k8s.io/default/team-a-secrets/example-api/token` resolves the `token`
entry in that Kubernetes Secret. The `default` locator and an explicit key are required.
The provider reads Kubernetes on every fetch and never persists or logs values.
AGW caches successful credentials per actor and URI for five minutes, so rotation
can take that long to reach injected requests.

Each request requires a trusted injector certificate with the configured SPIFFE
identity, an explicit atespace-to-namespace grant for the attested actor, and
Kubernetes `get` permission for the provider's ServiceAccount. Both installers
include the upstream get-only Secret ClusterRole and bind it to that ServiceAccount.
The provider can read Secrets across namespaces; its namespace policy controls
which namespaces each actor may use. Empty policies deny all requests.

## Configure the provider

Keep the pinned `images.agentgateway` image. It includes the
[protocol update](https://github.com/agentgateway/agentgateway/pull/3524) from
[this build](https://github.com/agentgateway/agentgateway/actions/runs/35238449333)
and implements the current [FetchSecret contract](../pkg/proto/credproviderpb/credprovider.proto).

Create the MITM CA Secret using the existing installation tooling:

```sh
hack/install-ate-kind.sh --create-egress-mitm-ca-pool-secret
```

The gateway needs `egress-mitm-ca-pool` with `tls.crt` and `tls.key` in its namespace.
Actors making HTTPS requests must trust this CA; see the
[MITM trust bundle guide](egress-trust-bundle.md).

For Helm, add these values to your release configuration:

```yaml
credentialProvider:
  namespacePolicies:
  - atespace: team-a
    allowedNamespaces: [team-a-secrets]
```

The Helm chart always deploys the provider and configures AGW's HTTP route and
HTTPS interception route. Namespace grants default to an empty list.
Policy changes roll the provider's Pods. Resource names and the injector identity
follow the release: release `demo` in namespace `platform` uses ServiceAccount
`demo-k8s-credential-provider`, endpoint
`demo-k8s-credential-provider.platform.svc:50051`, and injector identity
`spiffe://cluster.local/ns/platform/sa/demo-atenet-egress`.

HTTPS uses a dynamic backend: AGW selects the destination from the request and
validates its certificate using the system CA roots (`backendTLS: {}`). Public
APIs such as OpenAI and Anthropic need no per-backend certificates. The single
MITM CA lets AGW generate actor-facing certificates as needed. HTTP also travels
through the authenticated CONNECT tunnel, then leaves AGW over plaintext HTTP.

For the manifest installer, set your grants in
`manifests/egress-credential-injection/namespace-policy.yaml`, then deploy:

```sh
kubectl kustomize manifests/egress-credential-injection | ko apply -f -
hack/install-ate.sh --deploy-atenet \
  --atenet-dataplane=agentgateway --experimental-use-sdsmint
```

The policy file uses `policies:` with the same list of grants as the Helm values.
Its generated ConfigMap name changes with the policy, rolling the provider on
reapplication. Direct policy ConfigMap edits require a rollout restart. Client CA
bundles and serving certificates reload automatically for new TLS connections.

## Configure injection

Create the Secret and set an actor's egress policy header injection to use credential URI
`ate-secret://k8s.io/default/team-a-secrets/example-api/token`, header
`authorization`, and prefix `Bearer `. Namespace grants alone do not create an
egress policy. No ext_proc injector is needed.

## Tests

The Helm PR workflow installs the provider and MITM gateway from the start and
runs `internal/e2e/suites/credentials` alongside the standard suites with real actors,
Secrets, chart-managed RBAC, AGW, and the deployed provider. It checks
the exact injected token, an unauthenticated-origin control, namespace-policy
denial and cache isolation between atespaces. The local origin serves HTTP;
the suite uses the installed gateway configuration without modifying ConfigMaps.

Include `-f internal/e2e/suites/credentials/values.yaml` in the initial Helm
installation to grant the test atespace access. After deploying the standard
MITM egress fixtures, run the suites together:

```sh
E2E_ATENET_DATAPLANE=agentgateway E2E_CREDENTIAL_PROVIDER=1 E2E_EGRESS_MITM=1 \
  hack/run-e2e-kind.sh -v -args --no-color
```

The credential suite tests HTTP injection. The existing MITM suite checks HTTPS
interception and actor trust against a public HTTPS origin using the same install.
